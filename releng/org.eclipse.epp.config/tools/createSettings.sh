# The purpose of this little shell script is to generate a settings.xml
# for Maven that contains a list of packages (as activated profiles) based
# on the last commit to Git. The idea is that this helps to reduce the
# number of CPU cycles that are required in a Gerrit verification build job
# by building only the relevant packages. 
# (Relevant == the packages that are potentially affected by this change)
